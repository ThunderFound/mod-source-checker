# mod-source-checker
check if mod's hash matches mod's hash on modrinth and curseforge

cpp implementation of curseforge's fingerprint calculation is made by https://github.com/meza/curseforge-fingerprint
i just rewrote it in python, all credit to them
it is VERY slow (takes like 30s for like 15 files), so im improving it rn
